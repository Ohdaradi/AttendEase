## What to Look For:

After running this script, you should see:

1. **‚úÖ NEW CONSTRAINT EXISTS** - The attendance_unique_session constraint
2. **‚úÖ UPDATED_AT COLUMN EXISTS** - New column for tracking updates
3. **Multiple ‚úÖ INDEX EXISTS** entries - At least 15+ indexes created
4. **‚úÖ SUFFICIENT INDEXES** for all tables
5. **‚úÖ TRIGGER FUNCTION EXISTS** and **‚úÖ TRIGGER EXISTS**
6. **‚úÖ STATISTICS OPTIMIZED** for key columns
7. **üéâ ALL MIGRATIONS SUCCESSFUL!** in the final summary
